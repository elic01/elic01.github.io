## 🔴 REQUIRED: Set Up EmailJS (15 minutes)

Your contact form needs EmailJS to work properly.

2. **Add Email Service:**

   - Choose Gmail (or your email provider)
   - Connect your email account
   - **Copy your Service ID**

3. **Create Email Template:**
   - Click "Email Templates" → "Create New Template"
   - Use these variables: `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{message}}`
   - **Copy your Template ID**

4. **Get Public Key:**
   - Click "Account" → "API Keys"
   - **Copy your Public Key**

5. **Update your code:**
   Open `assets/js/main.js` and find this section (around line 10):
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       emailJS: {
           serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',      // ← Paste Service ID here
           templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',    // ← Paste Template ID here
           publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'        // ← Paste Public Key here
       },
